          <p>
           After graduating from the Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp, I started working as an 
           associate software engineer at Infosys. There, I learned the basics and advanced concepts of SDET, agile methodologies,
           and automated UI software testing, using tools such as Selenium and SOAPUI.
